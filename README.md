# Knapsack Problem Solver using Gravitational Search Algorithm

## A- WHAT IS KNAPSACK PROBLEM?
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is maximized.
The knapsack problem can be modeled as the following where:

## B- WHAT IS GRAVITATIONAL SEARCH ALGORITHM?
The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and the motion of celestial bodies. It simulates the gravitational forces between masses to search for the optimal solution in a problem space.

## C- METHODOLOGY
The methodology for solving the Knapsack Problem using the Gravitational Search Algorithm involves the following steps:

### STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
Initialize the population of solutions randomly within the search space.

### STEP 2: CALCULATION OF FITNESS VALUE AND MASS OF THE SOLUTIONS
Evaluate the fitness value of each solution based on its feasibility and objective function value. Calculate the mass of each solution.

### STEP 3: CALCULATION OF FORCE ON THE MASSES
Calculate the gravitational force acting on each solution based on its mass and the distance between solutions.

### STEP 4: CALCULATION OF ACCELERATION
Calculate the acceleration of each solution based on the gravitational force acting on it.

### STEP 5: UPDATING VELOCITY
Update the velocity of each solution based on its current velocity and acceleration.

### STEP 6: UPDATING POSITION
Update the position of each solution based on its current position and velocity.

## D- EVALUATION
